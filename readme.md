# Building Your Own Database Agent

IN COLLABORATION WITH

Microsoft

* Interact with tabular data and SQL databases using natural language, enabling more efficient and accessible data analysis.

* Gain hands-on experience with the Azure OpenAI Service, implementing techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling.

* Use Azure OpenAI Service’s Assistants API, and test it with function calling and code interpreter features.

## What you'll learn in this course

In __Building Your Own Database Agent__ you will develop an AI agent that interacts with databases using natural language, simplifying the process for querying and extracting insights. Created in partnership with Microsoft and taught by Adrian Gonzalez Sanchez, Data and AI Specialist at Microsoft, this course is designed for developers, data professionals, as well as business analysts and professionals who want more sophisticated interaction with their databases through natural language instead of advanced SQL queries.

What you’ll do in this course:

* Learn about the levels of knowledge customization with Azure OpenAI Service, focusing on RAG to build your first AI agent, deploy your Azure OpenAI Service instance, test the API, and set up an orchestration engine like LangChain to enable these scenarios.

* Load tabular data from a CSV file and perform natural language queries using the Azure OpenAI service to extract information quickly. Learn to reapply the agent to analyze your own CSV files.

* Implement LangChain agents to connect to a provided SQL database, and how to build a DB agent that translates natural language to SQL code.

* Use Azure OpenAI Service’s function calling feature to use pre-built functions for sending queries to databases, improving the efficiency and security of your SQL agent.

* Work with the Assistants API and test it with the function calling and code interpreter features, which will enable you to connect to SQL databases and create your own DB agents more efficiently.

By the end of the course, you’ll be equipped with the technical knowledge and practical experience to implement similar systems in your own projects or organizations, enabling more efficient and accessible data interaction and analysis. 

## Who should join?

If you want to learn how to interact with databases through natural language, this beginner-friendly course is for you. Familiarity with Python programming and databases (CSV files and SQL) is recommended, but not required.
